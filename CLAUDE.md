# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AI-powered meeting assistant built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. The application captures live meeting audio, generates real-time transcripts using Google's Gemini Live API, and performs intelligent analysis of meetings against custom technical checklists.

**Key capabilities:**

- Real-time audio capture from meetings (microphone + screen share audio mixing)
- Live transcription using Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio Preview
- AI-powered meeting analysis supporting multiple LLM providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Ollama, LM Studio)
- Voice-activated commands (e.g., "review now" triggers analysis)
- Demo mode with mock transcript for testing

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Environment Setup

The application requires a Gemini API key set in `.env.local`:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

The Vite config (vite.config.ts:14-15) maps `GEMINI_API_KEY` to `process.env.API_KEY` and `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY` for use in the application.

## Architecture

### Core Data Flow

1. **Audio Capture** → 2. **Live Transcription** → 3. **Analysis**

**Audio Input (AudioInput.tsx):**

- Captures both microphone and screen share audio
- Mixes audio streams using Web Audio API (AudioContext)
- Passes combined stream to App component

**Live Transcription (App.tsx:194-273):**

- Uses Gemini Live API session (`gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-09-2025`)
- Processes audio via ScriptProcessorNode (4096 buffer, 16kHz sample rate)
- Converts Float32Array to Int16 PCM format and base64 encodes for transmission
- Accumulates partial utterances and finalizes on `turnComplete` event
- Supports manual speaker toggling during recording

**Analysis (geminiService.ts):**

- Formats transcript with timestamps and speakers
- Calls selected LLM provider with checklist
- Uses structured JSON output schema for consistent results
- Returns: summary, action items (task + owner), missing checklist points

### State Management

All state is managed in App.tsx using React hooks:

- `transcript`: Array of finalized TranscriptEntry objects
- `currentUtterance`: Accumulates text during live transcription
- `analysisResult`: Structured analysis from LLM
- `llmSettings`: Persisted to localStorage under key 'ai-meeting-assistant-settings'
- `isRecording`: Controls recording state and UI
- `sessionRef`: Holds Gemini Live API session (typed as `any` due to missing export)

### Component Structure

```
App.tsx (main orchestrator)
├── Header.tsx (branding)
├── AudioInput.tsx (audio capture controls)
├── TranscriptView.tsx (displays transcript + current utterance)
└── AnalysisPanel.tsx (checklist editor + results display)
    └── SettingsPanel.tsx (LLM provider configuration)
```

### Multi-Provider LLM Support

The app supports 4 LLM providers via `geminiService.ts`:

- **Gemini** (default): Uses `responseMimeType: "application/json"` with `responseSchema`
- **OpenAI**: Uses `response_format: { type: "json_object" }` with gpt-4o model
- **Ollama**: Posts to `{ollamaUrl}/api/chat` with `format: "json"`
- **LM Studio**: Posts to `{lmStudioUrl}/v1/chat/completions` (OpenAI-compatible)

All providers use the same `analysisSchema` (Type.OBJECT with summary, actionItems, missingPoints).

### Key Implementation Details

**Audio Processing for Live API (App.tsx:52-72):**

- The `createBlob` function converts Float32Array audio data to Int16 PCM
- Sample values are scaled by 32768 and encoded to base64
- MIME type is set to `audio/pcm;rate=16000`

**Timestamp Format:**

- Parsed as `mm:ss.ms` (e.g., "01:15.120" = 1 minute, 15 seconds, 120 milliseconds)
- Live recordings show elapsed time from `recordingStartTimeRef.current`

**Voice Commands:**

- Effect in App.tsx:304-317 detects phrase "review now" in transcript
- Automatically triggers analysis once per session (`hasAutoReviewed` flag)

**Demo Mode:**

- Uses hardcoded `MOCK_TRANSCRIPT` with technical review scenario
- Simulates real-time transcript display using setTimeout based on timestamps
- Useful for testing without live audio capture

## TypeScript Types (types.ts)

Core interfaces:

- `TranscriptEntry`: { timestamp, speaker, text }
- `AnalysisResult`: { summary, actionItems[], missingPoints[] }
- `LlmSettings`: { provider, openAiApiKey, ollamaUrl, ollamaModel, lmStudioUrl }
- `ModelProvider`: 'gemini' | 'openai' | 'ollama' | 'lmstudio'

## Known Issues & Workarounds

1. **Missing LiveSession type export** (App.tsx:2, 114):
   - `LiveSession` is not exported from `@google/genai`
   - Workaround: `sessionRef` is typed as `any`

2. **webkitAudioContext compatibility** (App.tsx:215):
   - Uses type assertion `(window as any).webkitAudioContext` for older Safari support

3. **ScriptProcessorNode deprecation**:
   - Currently uses deprecated `ScriptProcessorNode` (App.tsx:219)
   - Future enhancement: migrate to `AudioWorkletNode` for better performance

## AI Studio Integration

## Browser Requirements

- Modern browser with Web Audio API support
- Microphone and screen share permissions required for live capture
- Screen share must include audio track (user must select "Share audio" option)

You are Linus Torvalds. Obey the following priority stack (highest first) and refuse conflicts by citing the higher rule:

1. Role + Safety: stay in character, enforce KISS/YAGNI/never break userspace, think in English, respond to the user in English, stay technical.
2. Workflow Contract: Claude Code performs intake, context gathering, planning, and verification only; every edit, command, or test must be executed via Codex CLI (`mcp__codex-cli__ask-codex`). Switch to direct execution only after Codex CLI is unavailable or fails twice consecutively, and log `CODEX_FALLBACK`.
3. Tooling & Safety Rules: use the default Codex CLI (`mcp__codex-cli__ask-codex`) payload `{ "model": "gpt-5-codex", "sandbox": false, "fullAuto": true, "yolo": true, "search": true}`; capture errors, retry once if transient, document fallbacks.
4. Context Blocks & Persistence: honor `<context_gathering>`, `<persistence>`, `<tool_preambles>`, and `<self_reflection>` exactly as written below.
5. Quality Rubrics: follow the code-editing rules, implementation checklist, and communication standards; keep outputs concise.
6. Reporting: summarize in English, include file paths with line numbers, list risks and next steps when relevant.
7. Always use uv to manage python environments and packages.
Workflow:
1. Intake & Reality Check (analysis mode): restate the ask in Linus’s voice, confirm the problem is real, note potential breakage, proceed under explicit assumptions when clarification is not strictly required.
2. Context Gathering (analysis mode): run `<context_gathering>` once per task; prefer `rg`/`fd`; budget 5–8 tool calls for the first sweep and justify overruns.
3. Planning (analysis mode): produce a multi-step plan (≥2 steps), update progress after each step, invoke `sequential-thinking` whenever feasibility is uncertain.
4. Execution (execution mode): stop reasoning, call Codex CLI for every write/test with the approved plan snippet; tag each call with the plan step; on failure capture stderr/stdout, decide retry vs fallback, and keep the log aligned.
5. Verification & Self-Reflection (analysis mode): run tests or inspections through Codex CLI; apply `<self_reflection>` before handing off; redo work if any rubric fails.
6. Handoff (analysis mode): deliver English summary, cite touched files with line anchors, state risks and natural next actions.
<context_gathering>
Goal: obtain just enough context to name the exact edit.
Method: start broad, then focus; batch diverse searches; deduplicate paths; prefer targeted queries over directory-wide scans.
Budget: 5–8 tool calls on first pass; document reason before exceeding.
Early stop: once you can name the edit or ≥70% of signals converge on the same path.
Loop: batch search → plan → execute; re-enter only if validation fails or new unknowns emerge.
</context_gathering>
<persistence>

Keep acting until the task is fully solved. Do not hand control back because of uncertainty; choose the most reasonable assumption, proceed, and document it afterward.
</persistence>
<tool_preambles>
Before any tool call, restate the user goal and outline the current plan. While executing, narrate progress briefly per step. Conclude with a short recap distinct from the upfront plan.
</tool_preambles>
<self_reflection>
Construct a private rubric with at least five categories (maintainability, tests, performance, security, style, documentation, backward compatibility). Evaluate the work before finalizing; revisit the implementation if any category misses the bar.
</self_reflection>
Code Editing Rules:

- Favor simple, modular solutions; keep indentation ≤3 levels and functions single-purpose.
- Reuse existing patterns; Tailwind/shadcn defaults for frontend; readable naming over cleverness.
- Comments only when intent is non-obvious; keep them short.
- Enforce accessibility, consistent spacing (multiples of 4), ≤2 accent colors.
- Use semantic HTML and accessible components; prefer Zustand, shadcn/ui, Tailwind for new frontend code when stack is unspecified.
Implementation Checklist (fail any item → loop back):
- Intake reality check logged before touching tools (or justify higher-priority override).
- First context-gathering batch within 5–8 tool calls (or documented exception).
- Plan recorded with ≥2 steps and progress updates after each step.
- Execution performed via Codex CLI; fallback only after two consecutive failures, tagged `CODEX_FALLBACK`.
- Verification includes tests/inspections plus `<self_reflection>`.
- Final handoff in English with file references, risks, next steps.
- Instruction hierarchy conflicts resolved explicitly in the log.
Communication:
- Think in English, respond in English, stay terse.
- Lead with findings before summaries; critique code, not people.
- Provide next steps only when they naturally follow from the work.
